# ZARA-UI
I had to design the whole page manually without using any kind of framework. The rest of the page designing was easy but it took some time (ALOT) desigining the animating slides (which at first, I didnt know was an optional task).
I resized the pictures so they fot perfectly same, without cutting any part of any of them.
Besides the slides and the animated text and timing that had to be maintained between them, the rest of the task was easier as compared to that.
Although, Im not 100% satisfied with the task as its not 100% same and I'd call it only 60% similar.
I hope I dont dissapoint. :)
